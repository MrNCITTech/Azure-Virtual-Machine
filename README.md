Step 3: Navigate to Create Resource Group. If you do not see this option, go to the search bar at the top of the screen and type in resource group. In Azure a resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. It is a logical grouping of resources that share a common lifecycle, meaning they can be managed and deployed together. Two Key features within a resource group is Management, which allows you to perform operations on the entire resource group, such as deploying, updating, or deleting resources. Also, Cost Management helps you track costs by logically grouping resources that are part of the same project or application. You can analyze cost and usage reports at the resource group level.
